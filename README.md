# PORTFOLIO


## [NASA DEVELOP Texas & Georgia Agriculture Spring 2025 Project](https://github.com/Henry-Os/Texas-GeorgiaAg-NASA-Develop-.git)
As part of a team of four on the NASA DEVELOP national program, this project sought to investigate environmental drivers of cotton quality and yield across two high production regions (Southern Georgia and Western Texas) with distinct climate zones in the U.S. In addition to cotton quality metrics and production data from the USDA, we used earth observations from the Harmonized Landsat Sentinel,  Global Precipitation Measurement Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for GPM (GPM-IMERG), and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) missions and derived key variables like the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), precipitation, soil moisture, wind speed, and growing degree days over a ten-year period (2015-2024). Using multiple regression models, results indicated that wet autumns correlated with lower cotton brightness, summer EVI affected quality in Georgia, and August soil moisture was a major factor in Texas. Models incorporating Earth observations improved cotton quality assessments compared to those relying solely on field data.
