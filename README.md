**Abstract**

Declines in cotton quality and yield across the United States are raising concerns in the cotton industry. NASA DEVELOP partnered with the U.S. Department of Agriculture – Agricultural Research Service and Agricultural Marketing Service to identify environmental conditions driving cotton quality and yield in two high-production regions with distinct climate zones: Southern Georgia and Western Texas. The project used Earth observations (EO) from the Harmonized Landsat Sentinel initiative, Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for GPM, and the Soil Moisture Active Passive L-band radiometer to understand how climate and soil parameters correlate with cotton quality. The team analyzed Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), precipitation, soil moisture, wind speed, and growing degree days from 2015 to 2024, focusing on the months of May to November. Using multiple regression models, we found that wet autumns were associated with lower brightness in cotton crops across both states, summer EVI readings had moderate-to-strong associations with some quality variables in Georgia, and August soil moisture was an important driver of multiple quality variables in Texas. Models that used EO data generally performed better than models with only data from weather stations, with adjusted R-squared values ranging from 31.6 – 72.5%. A major limitation of the study, however, was the uncertainty about the exact location of the cotton fields that bales were grown in. The results of this feasibility study indicate the promise of incorporating remote sensing observations into predictions for the quality of cotton harvests.
